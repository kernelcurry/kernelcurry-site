Have you ever wanted to have a live picture wall or interactive slide show at a part or event?  Simply set a Twilio phone number to hit this script and you are ready to rock.

This simple project was coded at the Twilio MMS pre-release hack-a-thon in 2013.  It won and was featured at TwilioCon in 2013.  With a monitor and a number, everyone at the conference was able to share their photos in real time.
