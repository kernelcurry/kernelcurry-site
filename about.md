First and foremost, I love music, ever since beginning playing percussion in fifth grade.  By happenstance in 2003, I was introduced to dance and ended up perusing that for years.  In 2007 and 2009, I  traveled the United States with the Academy Drum and Bugle Corp as a color guard member.  During this time, I was lucky enough to also teach percussion and color guard at an Arizona high school.  Teaching has been, by far, my most rewarding work to date.  With this strong musical background, I originally started out studying music education at Arizona State University.  After a few years and some persuasion, I took on software engineering full-time.  Several contracting gigs and even more side projects later, I landed a job a [SplitOne Technologies](http://www.splitone.com/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio).  Taking the knowledge learned there about how a contracting company operates, a year later, I started at [Vuurr](http://vuurr.com/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio).  Hands down, the people I met at Vuurr are some of the most highly motivated; always pushing harder and setting the bar as high as it can go!  We made the jump from Arizona to San Francisco in late 2013 and created the amazing startup, [Levers](http://leve.rs/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio).  Levers focused on forecasting your marketing dollars and telling you exactly where to spend your money for the best return possible.  Numerous sleepless nights coding and crazy adventures in San Francisco taught me one thing: if you want something, you have to just build it and put it out there.  It doesn’t need to be perfect, it just has to be an MVP.  Once you have that, you can take off running.  Currently, I’m working at another startup, [Stitch Labs](http://www.stitchlabs.com/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio), learning so much about growth from a company and a scaling standpoint.   Living in San Francisco has been a wild ride so far, and I plan to ride this wave as long as I can.
