My name is Michael Ian Curry, and I am a developer.  I am currently the lead engineer at [Levers](http://leve.rs/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio), a predictive analytics platform. Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University. Before my graduation, I already utilized my experience in PHP, JS, C, C++, Java and MySQL as an independent contractor and at [SplitOne](http://www.splitone.com/?utm_source=kernelcurry.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bio). In early 2013, I also started as a developer with [Vuurr](Vuurr), a digital marketing agency in Chandler, AZ, where I easily transitioned into one of Leversâ€™ top developers.
