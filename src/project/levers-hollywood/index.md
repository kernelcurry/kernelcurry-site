Levers Hollywood consumed the entire IMDb & Rotten Tomatoes databases and used graph theory to map opening weekend revenue between film, director, actor, and producer. We used this to build a multiple linear regression model that analyzed the influence of social media mentions, release date, MPAA rating, and more.

We ran it on a handful of upcoming films and ended up within single digit percentages of actual take in several cases.
