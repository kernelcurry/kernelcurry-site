Stitch is an online inventory control solution that simplifies multichannel retail business. During my time at Stitch Labs, I led a team that designed and built a subscription model enabling the company to grow from $2 million to $6+ million in annual recurring revenue. I overhauled our customer acquisition funnel, providing insight into customer behavior and increasing visibility to sales metrics. I also designed and built the underlying infrastructure to facilitate migration from a database management provider to an in-house managed solution. On a daily basis I work with cross-functional teams to accelerate the development cycle and ensure stable releases.
