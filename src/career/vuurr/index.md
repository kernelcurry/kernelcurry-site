Vuurr specializes in digital marketing campaigns and custom application development for clients ranging from startups & small businesses to $10+ billion enterprises.

#### Subset of the projects I worked on:
* Numerous marketing websites and blogs using WordPress as a framework.
* A customer loyalty and marketing system for the tire and service industry.
* An international education system that allowed users to search and pay for classes towards their desired certifications and giving controls to instructors to award credits to the students based on performance.
* A political campaign website for a United States governor.
* An internal organizational application used to track and update printing orders from in-store/online to delivery
* A Food and crafts website that has ~1.5 million sessions per month and growing.

### Retrospective

Vuurr moved quickly and the bar was set high from day one. I was forced to learn things most people don't learn until much later in their careers.  From understanding the cost of context switching to communicating directly with customers and setting realistic expectations to understanding the power of execution... even if it did cost a few very late nights... weeks.  Plus, I met some life long friends through our adventures as a company. All in all, I am very grateful Vuurr extended an offer, and hope everyone is lucky enough to find a position like this in their career.
