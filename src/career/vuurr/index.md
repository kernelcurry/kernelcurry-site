### Retrospective

Vuurr moved quickly and the bar was set high from day one. I was forced to learn things most people don't learn until much later in their careers.  From understanding the cost of context switching to communicating directly with customers and setting realistic expectations to understanding the power of execution... even if it did cost a few very late nights... weeks.  Plus, I met some life long friends through our adventures as a company. All in all, I am very grateful Vuurr extended an offer, and hope everyone is lucky enough to find a position like this in their career.oved quickly and the bar was set high from day one.
