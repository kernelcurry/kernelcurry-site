      <description>If you thought Tetris was fun, get ready Tetris with snakes! Yeah, actual Snakes; Wild Snakes. Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris, thought it would be a good idea to add snakes to the classic game. To be honest, when I started playing this game I thought it was just a crappy rip off of Tetris, but NOPE the creator of Tetris himself thought this was a good idea&amp;hellip; sigh.</description>

      <description>A few weekends ago, I flew into Arizona to attend the Game On Retro Expo with some old friends. Among this group was Dorion Whitlock (1994 Nintendo PowerFest finalist and old roommate) and Mike Iarossi (1994 Nintendo PowerFest first place winner). To say the least, I forgot how much fun it is playing video games with your friends.
The main draw for the Game On Retro Expo was the 1994 PowerFest Reunion Tournament.</description>

      <description>When looking for a more stable hosting solution for my Magic: The Gathering Api, I stumbled across Google&amp;rsquo;s App Engine. If you have not read up on this solution, I would recommend it.
To get Laravel&amp;rsquo;s Lumen running correctly on Google App Engine, there are a few questions that we need to answer. Lets take these one at a time.
How does the application know it is running on Google App Engine?</description>

      <description>Pros and Cons There are lots of pros and cons when it comes to WordPress vs Jekyll. After looking through this list you might decide that Jekyll is not for you, and that is fine. Just remember that every tool is used for different tasks and neither WordPress nor Jekyll can be declared &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; as they are both good in different situations.
Jekyll Pros  Speed : No PHP is called or needs to be executed.</description>

      <description>The ability for PHP programs to execute asynchronous functions… Yeah, I said it and now it exists. By coding in Facebook’s new Hack Language, using your CPU’s cycles correctly has never been so easy. Let’s delve into this new language head first!
/** * This function calls async functions */ function main() : void { echo &#39;[main] Calling Async Function&#39;.&#34;\n&#34;; $asyncCall = getInfo(); echo &#39;[main] Triangulating Atlantis&#39;.&#34;\n&#34;; echo &#39;[main] Calculating the Meaning Of Life&#39;.</description>

      <description>Overview This last week I was lucky enough to step onto Facebook&amp;rsquo;s campus for their first ever Hack Developer Day. Throughout the day developers and project managers gave talks about HHVM and Hack. From overviews to the nitty gritty details, each talk brought more insight into why this language was created. Below are a few of the talks that I thought were the best of the bunch.

      <title>How To Make An Object Oriented WordPress Plugin</title>

      <description>You just learned how to create a simple WordPress plugin, and now you hear people talking about how WordPress is becoming more object-oriented. What does that mean? Lets take a step back and start with the basics.
Most simple WordPress plugins are written using procedural programming. This means that your code excited from top to bottom; calling functions and setting variables along the way. A prime example of this is the default WordPress plugin: Hello Dolly.</description>

      <description>Have you ever needed to convert a 2 dimensional array into a CSV then force a download? Well, I have, and here is how I did it:
Array Every internal array must have the same keys. These keys may be set to null, but the key must exist. Below is a sample array that we can work with through this example.

      <description>For the past year, every Wednesday night at about 6:00 p.m. work stops! Since I have been working for Levers there has been a weekly hack night. To put it simply: &amp;ldquo;Stop your real work and work on something fun!&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;
There have been some winning hack night projects and some losing ones. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look:

      <title>Why You Should Use C With Php</title>

      <description>A few months ago, I calculated the top Magic: The Gathering cards in the games modern format [LINK_BROKEN]. This was accomplished using pure PHP. In total it took about 30 minutes to calculate. With a 30 minute runtime, I wanted to find a faster way to crunch the numbers. What better way than to use C.
As I did not want to spend the time rewriting code if it did not make a difference, I thought I would use a simple application for this experiment: Calculating the nth term of the fibonacci sequence.</description>

For years I did not only &amp;ldquo;not have a good website&amp;rdquo;, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a website at all. finally, I decided to make something. It may not be the prettiest thing in the world, but hey&amp;hellip; at least it is a website.
This site will be used as a gateway to all of my projects and discoveries over the years.</description>
