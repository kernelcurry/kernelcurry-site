"The plumber always has plumbing problems at home." ... "Carpenters buy their furniture at IKEA." ... "The developers never has a good website"...

For years I did not only "not have a good website", but I didn't have a website at all.  finally, I decided to make something.  It may not be the prettiest thing in the world, but hey... at least it is a website.

This site will be used as a gateway to all of my projects and discoveries over the years.  I hope that these posts will educate and inspire.

Let the journey begin!
